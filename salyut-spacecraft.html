					<p>The Salyut space stations are themselves spacecraft, orbiting the Earth at an altitude of around 200km to 270km. Each of the Salyut stations was launched as a spacecraft, by a Proton K carrier rocket, and then used its own engines to reach orbit. Expedition crews and visiting cosmonauts were transported to the stations on Soyuz crew spacecraft launched on Soyuz carrier rockets.</p>
					<p>The later stations, six and seven, were supplied by un-crewed Progress spacecraft also launched on Soyuz carrier rockets. These stations were also visited by un-crewed TKS spacecraft for testing purposes.</p>

					<!-- Spacecraft Mission Steps -->

					<div class="barH2" style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0;"><h2>Spacecraft Mission Steps</h2>
					</div>
					<p>The mission of a spacecraft to the stations has five main steps:-</p>
					<div class="barH3"><h3>1. Launching</h3>
					</div>
					<p>The first step is to launch the spacecraft and overcome the Earth's gravity so that it can be placed in a similar orbit to the station. The launching method varies depending on the size and type of craft being launched.</p>
					<p>The launch vehicles are generally multi-staged. The first stages use a number of large engines to lift the weight of the spacecraft, launch vehicle and fuel. When the first stage fuel is used the stage and fuel tanks are discarded to be destroyed. Subsequent stages use smaller engines to enable the spacecraft to reach orbit.</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>2. Rendezvous</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Once the spacecraft is in orbit it needs to catch up and match velocity with the station. The launch vehicle can only place the spacecraft in particular orbits relative to the launching place on Earth. Spacecraft then use their own rocket engines to catch up to the station, match its orbital altitude and speed and dock with the station.</p>
					
					<div class="barH3"><h3>3. Docking</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Using remote control from the station or Earth, small rocket engines (thrusters) on the craft are used to guide it to the docking point. After initial contact the docking mechanism pulls the craft in and securely locks it to the station with an air tight seal.</p>
				
					<div class="barH3"><h3>4. Un-docking</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Un-docking is the reverse procedure to docking and uses a similar method. After un-docked the spacecraft uses its thruster to move to a safe distance clear of the station and then uses its main engines to slow down for de-orbit.</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>5. De-orbiting</h3>
					</div>
					<p>When the spacecraft has slowed sufficiently gravity pulls the craft into the Earth's atmosphere. If the craft is designed to return to Earth it uses heat shields to slow it's speed amd parachutes for its final descent. Progress un-piloted craft are not intended to return to Earth and are destroyed by the friction of entering the atmosphere.</p>

					<!-- Spacecraft Mission Categories -->

					<div class="barH2" style="margin: 0;"><h2>Spacecraft Mission Categories</h2>
					</div>

					<p class="padt">Spacecraft missions to the station can be grouped into the following three categories:-</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>1. Main Component Delivery</h3>
					</div>
					<p>All Salyut station consisted of a single module which was the main component. They were all launched using a Russian Proton-K rocket. They then attained the planned orbit using their own engines. They maintained their orbit by using their own engined of with the assistance of docked space craft.</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>2. Station Crew Transport</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Longer duration crew missions to the stations were called 'Expeditions' while shorter duration were called 'Visiting' crews. Soyuz 7K-T crew craft were used to transport crews to Salyut One to Five and some for Salyut Six. The new Soyuz T craft was used on later missions to Salyut Six and all missions to Salyut Seven.</span></p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>3. Supplies and Materials</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Supplies include all those goods needed to operate, maintain, live in and use the station. Salyut stations were habitable spacecraft and needed to be maintained in orbit and provide life support for their crew and visitors. They therefore required regular deliveries of consumables such as fuel, water, food, oxygen and spare parts. They were also a working research stations requiring specific equipment and the transport of experiment materials from and to the Earth.</p>
					<p>Ony a small amount of supplies were able to be carried with the crew in the Soyuz craft. This was sufficient for the earlier stations, one to five. Stations six and seven had longer durations crew stays, therefore most of the supplies were delivered using the Russian Progress cargo craft. These vehicles are not designed to return to Earth, therefore after the completion of their missions they are de-orbited and deliberately destroyed.</p>
			
					<div class="barH2" style="margin: 0;"><h2>Spacecraft and Launcher Types</h2>
					</div>
					<p>The table below lists the types of spacecraft and launchers used to transport crew and cargo to the Salyut stations and to test new spacecraft.</p>
					<p class="color-small padb">All station modules were launched using Proton-K rockets.</p>
