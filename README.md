Salyut Space Stations Article

The Soviet Union Salyut programme (Russian: meaning "salute" or "fireworks") was the first to launch space station modules into orbit. The programme involved a series of four crewed scientific research space stations and two crewed military reconnaissance space stations over a period of 15 years, from 1971 to 1986. Two other Salyut launches failed.

The Salyut stations were designed to carry out long-term research into living in space and a variety of astronomical, biological and Earth-resources experiments.

The Soviet Union also wanted to regain its lead in the Space Race with the U.S. after failing to put the first human on the moon.
