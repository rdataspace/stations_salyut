					<p>The Mir space station is itself a spacecraft, orbiting the Earth at an altitude of between 354km and 374km. Each of the main components, except the Docking Module, was launched as a spacecraft, by a carrier rocket, and used its own power to reach and dock with Mir.</p>
					<p>These components had their own engines except Kvant-1 which used a spacecraft tug.</p>
					<p>The Docking Module was delivered to Mir by U.S. Space Shuttle.</p>

						<p>Apart from the Shuttles 6 missions, only two type of spacecraft were used to service Mir.</p>
						<p>Firstly variants of the Soviet/Russian Soyuz spacecraft were used to transport expedition and visiting crew to Mir. The other spacecraft were variants of the Soviet/Russian Progress, un-piloted, cargo spacecraft for supplies and equipment.</p>

			<div class="barH2"><h2>Spacecraft Mission Steps</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="grid-2col">

				<!-- Left col -->

				<div class="leftCol">				
					<p>The mission of a spacecraft to the station has five main steps:-</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>1. Launching</h3>
					</div>
					<p>The first step is to launch the spacecraft and overcome the Earth's gravity so that it can be placed in a similar orbit to the station.</p>
					<p>The launching method varies depending on the size and type of craft being launched. All launch vehicles, however, use either liquid or solid fuelled rocket engines.</p>
					<p>The launch vehicles are also generally multi-staged. The first stage usually use a number of large engines to initially lift the weight of the spacecraft, launch vehicle and fuel. When the first stage fuel is used the stage and fuel tanks are discarded to be destroyed or returned to Earth for re-use. The craft is then lighter and subsequent stages use smaller engines. These stages are similarly discarded until only the spacecraft remains in orbit.</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>2. Rendezvous</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Once the spacecraft is in orbit it needs to catch up and match velocity and orbit with the station.</p>
					<p class="mb0">The launch vehicle can only place the spacecraft in particular orbits relative to the launching place on Earth. Spacecraft then use their own rocket engines to catch up to the station and match its orbital altitude and speed. The craft is then motionless, relative to the station, and can be docked.</span></p>
				</div>
				
				<!-- Right col -->

				<div class="rightCol">				
					<div class="barH3"><h3>3. Docking</h3>
					</div>
					<p class="padt">Two methods are used to attach the spacecraft securely to the station with an air-tight seal.</p>
					<p><span class="color">Powered Docking</span> - Using remote control from the station or Earth, small rocket engines (thrusters) on the craft are used to guide it to the docking point. After initial contact the docking mechanism pulls the craft in and securely locks it to the station with an air tight seal.</p>
					<p><span class="color">Capture Docking</span> - The station's robot arm is used to grapple a fixture on the craft and move it into the initial docking contact position. This method is only used for the smaller un-piloted craft.</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>4. Un-docking</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Un-docking is the reverse procedure to docking and uses a similar method. After un-docked the spacecraft uses its thruster to move to a safe distance clear of the station and then uses its main engines to slow down for de-orbit.</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>5. De-orbiting</h3>
					</div>
					<p>When the spacecraft has slowed sufficiently gravity pulls the craft into the Earth's atmosphere. If the craft is designed to return to Earth it will either land or use parachutes for its final descent. Some un-piloted craft are not intended to return to Earth and are destroyed by the friction of entering the atmosphere.</p>

			<div class="barH2"><h2>Spacecraft Mission Categories</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="grid-2col">

				<!-- Left col -->

				<div class="leftCol">				

					<p>Spacecraft missions to the station can be grouped into the following three categories:-</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>1. Main Component Delivery</h3>
					</div>
					<p>The first main component, The Core Module, was launched on a Proton-K rocket and reached the planned orbit using its own engines. The second main component, Kvant-1, had no propulsion system. Instead it used a TKS-E type propulsion module to dock with the Core Module. The TKS-E was the jettisoned. With the exception of the Docking Module, all the other main components used their own engines the match orbit and dock to the Core Module. The Docking module was delivered and installed by a U.S. Space Shuttle.</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>2. Station Crew Transport</h3>
					</div>
					<p class="mb0">The station crews were flown to the station in Russian Soyuz T and TM craft using either a Russian Soyuz U or U2 booster rocket. A Soyuz craft always remained docked to the station for use as an emergency escape vehicle for the station crew. It was regularly replaced with a "fresh" craft of the same type.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Right col -->

				<div class="rightCol">				
					<div class="barH3"><h3>3. Supplies and Materials</h3>
					</div>
					<p class="padt">Supplies include all those goods needed to operate, maintain, live in and use the station. Mir is a habitable spacecraft and needs to be maintained in orbit and provide life support for its crew and visitors. It therefore requires regular deliveries of consumables such as fuel, water, food, oxygen and spare parts. It is also a working research station requiring specific equipment and the transport of experiment materials from and to the Earth.</p>
					<p>Ony a small amount of supplies were able to be carried with the crew in the Soyuz craft. Most of the supplies were delivered using the Russian Progress cargo craft. These vehicles are designed to return to Earth, therefore after the completion of their missions they are de-orbited and deliberately destroyed.</p>
